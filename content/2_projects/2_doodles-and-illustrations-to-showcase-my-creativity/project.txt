The talking cloud is half open; this symbolizes the accessibility to discuss all theme\u2019s of Senz. Holistic (holism) = everything is inextricably linked. I translated that by connecting the e + n in the typography. The logo is both modern and sleek and soft and inviting. The orange color contrasts with the blue-black color which the customer found very appealing and I myself find the appropriate colors for the logo. I have designed separate image elements for the different themes: life, together, energy and strong. These can optionally be applied to various expressions, such as the website, poster, visiting card etc.",
