What I am learning here is to design meaningful interactive products and services for the human: website, app, interactive installation, to full experience. Before I start designing I research the user needs of the organization. I continuously check with the user for the design and doing this involve patients also include location. Designing is after all: making prototypes, testing, failure, redesigning, testing, adjusting, etc. I'm busy sketching, researching, building or researching outside the door. I'm learning to work based on the interests and perception of users and clients. An active attitude is a prerequisite for the design process at Communication and Multimedia Design. As well as a healthy dose of curiosity, courage and independence to deliver high-quality work. In addition, I learn to look critically at my work and actions.",
